/* The items inside a flex container:

can be organized in any direction (leftwards, rightwards, downwards or even upwards) (flex-direction).
can have direct (left-to-right) or reversed (right-to-left) order.
can have “flex” width and height to fill the available space (flex-item).
can be set to dynamically collapse or expand along the main axis, and in the meantime preserve the size of the secondary cross axis.
can be organized linearly along the main axis or wrapped into multiple lines along or across the cross axis. */
